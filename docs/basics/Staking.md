## MINT Staking
Stakers stake their MINT to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceeds from bond sales, and can vary based on the number of MINT staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

## NFT Staking
Genesis CryptoHoots and auction NFTs can be staked in exchange for a portion of MINTs minted  by the protocol. These rewards come from the proceeds after bond sales.

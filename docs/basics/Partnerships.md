# Partnerships
Projects that choose to partner with ShuffleDAO will allocate a portion of the ETH earned from sales and potentially royalties. In return, NFTs from these projects will be able to claim MINT tokens over time through a staking or yielding mechanic. 

## Example Partnership
A new NFT project—Happy Toadz—decides to partner with the DAO for additional development support and MINT tokens. Assume MINT is trading at one million MINTs per ETH:
- Happy Toadz allocates 20% of their earnings from initial sales to the DAO.
- Because Happy Toadz used development and other DAO resources, they will receive an amount of MINT tokens equal to 50% of the value of the ETH they send  to the DAO.
- The project is a success and sells out their edition of 5000 NFTs, earning a total of 500E. 
- The DAO receives 100E.
- Happy Toadz is allocated 50 million MINT (50ETH).
- Happy Toadz holders can claim 10,000 MINT per NFT.

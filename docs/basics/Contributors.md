# Contributors
ShuffleDAO is a service DAO and has contributors across a wide range of skills including developers, artists, writers, Discord moderators and lawyers. Our gaol is to provide the best possible services to our partners and to do that we need to maintain a roster of talent. One way we accomplish this is through our compensation model. 

The DAO is currently using a system based around work units (WUs). Earings are pooled across all launched projects within a specified epoch. At the end of each epoch earnings are distributed to contributors based the number of WUs earned. This system ensures an equitable distribution between all contributors by not tying individual compensation to a single project.

Our current work unit table uses the following values:

 |**Task**|**Work Units Earned**
:-----:|:-----:
Solidity - Expert|20
Solidity - Complex|10
Solidity - Simple|3
Frontend - Complex|8
Frontend - Simple|2
Full Collection Art|10
Art Generation|3
Discord Setup|1
Project Manager|3
3D/VX|4
Legal/Negotiations|0.2
Lore/Writing/Editing|1
Marketing/Promo|3
Referral|0.2
Infrastructure|10

WU values are likely to evolve as we grow and add new task types to the list.

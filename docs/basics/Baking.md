# Baking
Baking is an accrual strategy for the ShuffleDAO treasury. It allows the protocol to acquire its own liquidity and other treasury assets like ETH and rETH by selling MINT at a discount in exchange for those assets. Baking vests over 5 days and bakers are able claim MINT tokens as they vest. 

MINT has an intrinsic value of  0.000001 ETH. In order to make a profit from bonding, ShuffleDAO charges a premium for each bake.


BakePrice = 0.000001E + Premium

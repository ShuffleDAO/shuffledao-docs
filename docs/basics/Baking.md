# Baking
Baking is an accrual strategy for the ShuffleDAO treasury. It allows the protocol to acquire its own liquidity and other treasury assets like ETH and rETH in exchange for MINT tokens. Baking responds to supply and demand through a variable premium or discount compared to the market price of MINT. 

Bakers provide ETH or LP tokens up front and receive MINT over a set period of time. The baking premium is determined by the demand for specific bakes and the Baking Control Variable (BCV) which is set by the policy team.

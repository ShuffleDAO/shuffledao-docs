# Governance

## Governance Structure

Due to ShuffleDAOs unique scope of work, there is a requirement for multiple layers of Governance. ShuffleDAOs governance decisions will be made primarily by two key groups, Delegates and Committees. 

- Delegates
    - Comprised from two groups:
        - Core Contributors make up the DAOs Founders, Developers, Artists, and Project Managers who work alongside our partner projects and are responsible for the DAOs design thus far.
        - Community members who will be appointed by community members to represent the communities’ interest in DAO matters.
    - Initially there will be 2 community members appointed as delegates.
    - The number of community delegates will increase by 1 for every additional 500 ETH in the protocol treasury with an initial cap of 10.
    - All delegates will serve a term of 6 months.
    - Delegates can be removed prior to their term ending through a 2/3 majority vote. 
- Committees
    - Centered around topics the community deems necessary to provide direction for the DAO.
    - Membership will be assigned via DAO votes.
    - Committee memberships have a term of 6 months.
    - Can be any community member.

# Governance Process

Proposals will go through multiple stages before going up for a vote.

### **Phase 1: Temperature Check - Forum / Discord**

The purpose of the Temperature Check is to determine if there is sufficient will to make changes to the status quo.

To create a Temperature Check, ask a general, non-biased question to the community about a potential change. Temperature checks are informal; it's up to you to use the feedback to decide if you want to proceed further with your proposal.

### **Phase 2: Draft Proposal - Forum**

The purpose of the Draft Proposal is to establish formal discussion around a potential proposal.

Reach out to your network to build support for the proposal. Discuss the proposal and solicit delegates to provide feedback on it. Be willing to respond to questions on the Consensus Check topic. Share your viewpoint, although try to remain as impartial as possible.

To indicate community support for the proposal, there will be a predetermined amount of likes on the post to move forward to a vote. The initial threshold will be 10 likes on the proposal, scaling up as the community grows.

### **Phase 3: Active Proposal — Discourse / Snapshot**

Request that a moderator advances your proposal to a vote by tagging @moderators in a reply. They will:

1. Move your proposal from Draft Proposals to Active Proposals.
2. Assign your proposal a proposal number in the form SIP###.
3. Create a snapshot vote for your proposal with a duration of 5 days, and link to it from your proposal post.


### **Phase 4: Voting**

Once a snapshot vote is active it will be voted on by delegates. If the vote passes the proposal is approved and is implemented.

## Governance Rights

The following tokens will have Governance rights in the DAO. The number of votes per-token is still under development. In order of most votes per token to least:

1. Daily Auction NFTs
2. CryptoHoot NFTs
3. veMINT

## Delegation

Anyone with governance rights can delegate their vote to their preferred delegate. The delegates with the most votes will be elected for a 6 month term. Each delegate will only have 1 vote when participating in governance. The amount of tokens delegated to them from the community is only used for the election process.

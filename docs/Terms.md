# APR
Annual Percentage Rate, is the annualized interest rate without taking the effect of compounding into account.
 
# APY 
Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are rather ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.

# BCV 
Bake Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which bake prices change. A higher BCV means a lower discount for bakers and higher inflation by the protocol. A lower BCV means a higher discount for bakers and lower inflation by the protocol.

# DAO 
Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. In OlympusDAO the governance token is gOHM. At this time, only gOHM on the Ethereum chain can be used to vote. gOHM deposited in a staking/lending pool, or LP pairing cannot be used to vote.

# POL 
Protocol Owned Liquidity 

# PCV 
Protocol Controlled Value, is the amount of funds the treasury owns and controls. The more PCV the better for the protocol and its users.

# PoR 
Proof of Reserve, is the mechanism of strengthening the reserve of ShuffleDAO treasury via sales of bakes. Bakers provide liquidity to the treasury, thereby building its reserve. In return for their service, bakers get paid in MINT.

# Reward Rate
Reward rate is the configured percentage of MINT distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely set by the policy team.

# Reward Yield 
Reward yield refers to the actual amount of MINT received by each staker on each rebase. The reward yield is a rough target from a policy point of view. It can almost never be maintained precisely due to e.g. fluctuating amounts of MINT staked.

# RRV 
Reduced-risk value 

# SLP 
Sushiswap Liquidity Provider, is the token received when providing liquidity on Sushiswap. For instance LP bonds require SLP tokens of the OHM / DAI pair.

# TVL 
Total Value Locked, is the dollar amount of all MINT staked in the protocol. This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects.

# TWAP
Time Weighted Average Price, is the average price of an asset over a specified time. TWAPs are used to represent the fair value of an asset as defined by the market.

# MINT 
Governance token for the ShuffleDAO ecosystem

# pMINT 
Private MINT. Allocated to the team, contributors, advisors, and the DAO vested over time 

# sMINT 
Staked MINT 

# wsMINT 
Wrapped Staked MINT, a non-rebasing wraper for sMINT. This allows the token to be used across chains 

# veMINT 
An extention of wsMINT, sMINT can be locked for a period of time in order to receive veMINT

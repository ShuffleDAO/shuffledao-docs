# Introduction


## What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is an NFT incubator and community currency. Our goal is to streamline the NFT development process and unify NFT economies with our token MINT.


### How to participate in ShuffleDAO
Participation comes in many forms. Anyone holding MINT tokens, [CryptoHoot](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptohoots-steampunk-parliament/) or Candy NFTs can participate in DAO governance. Those interested in working with the DAO directly can apply to become a DAO contributor working directly with our partners. ShuffleDAO has a compelling compensation structure for contributors and we are always looking for talented artists, developers and marketers.  


### How to partner with ShuffleDAO
Interested in seeing if we can help with your upcoming NFT project? Head to our Discord and reach out to the team to schedule a meeting. After projects are presented to the review board we will begin the onboarding process.

Project proposals are not shared with or voted on by the public DAO community. Details are only shared with the internal project review board.

### MINT
ShuffleDAO's goal is to create a unified token that can be earned and used across all projects in our ecosystem. MINT is backed by ETH in the DAO treasury and distributed to our partner communities.

MINT has a number of advantages compared to project specific tokens:
- **Liquidity:** The DAO treasury aims to own all of its liquidity ensuring users are always able to exchange MINT.
- **Composability:** A single token can be used in a grown list of project ecosystems. This benefits both holders and projects with a more dynamic token economy.
- **Value:** MINT is backed by ETH giving the token a hard floor or intrinsic value. New tokens are only created when there is ETH in the treasury to back them ensuring there is not uncontrolled inflation.

# Introduction


## What is ShuffleDAO?
ShuffleDAO is an NFT incubator. Our token, MINT, is the community currency that backs our partner projects, providing long-term value to NFT holders. Our goal is to streamline the NFT development process and unify NFT economies using MINT.


### How to participate in ShuffleDAO
Participation comes in many forms. Anyone holding MINT tokens, [CryptoHoot](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptohoots-steampunk-parliament/) or Candy NFTs can participate in DAO governance. Those interested in working with the DAO directly can apply to become a DAO contributor working directly with our partners. ShuffleDAO has a compelling compensation structure for contributors and we are always looking for talented artists, developers and marketers.  


### How to partner with ShuffleDAO

### MINT
ShuffleDAO's goal is to create a unified token that can be earned and used across all projects in our ecosystem. MINT is backed by ETH in the DAO treasury and distributed to our partner communities.

#### MINT has a number of advantages compared to project specific tokens:
- **Liquidity:** The DAO treasury aims to own all of its liquidity ensuring users are always able to exchange MINT.
- **Composability:** A single token can be used in a grown list of project ecosystems. This benefits both holders and projects with a more dynamic token economy.
- **Value:** MINT is backed by ETH giving the token a hard floor or intrinsic value. New tokens are only created when there is ETH in the treasury to back them ensuring there is not uncontrolled inflation.
